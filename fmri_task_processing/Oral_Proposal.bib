	abstract = {Computed tomographic ({CT}) images are widely used for the identification of abnormal brain tissue following infarct and hemorrhage in stroke. Manual lesion delineation is currently the standard approach, but is both time-consuming and operator-dependent. To address these issues, we present a method that can automatically delineate infarct and hemorrhage in stroke {CT} images. The key elements of this method are the accurate normalization of {CT} images from stroke patients into template space and the subsequent voxelwise comparison with a group of control {CT} images for defining areas with hypo- or hyper-intense signals. Our validation, using simulated and actual lesions, shows that our approach is effective in reconstructing lesions resulting from both infarct and hemorrhage and yields lesion maps spatially consistent with those produced manually by expert operators. A limitation is that, relative to manual delineation, there is reduced sensitivity of the automated method in regions close to the ventricles and the brain contours. However, the automated method presents a number of benefits in terms of offering significant time savings and the elimination of the inter-operator differences inherent to manual tracing approaches. These factors are relevant for the creation of large-scale lesion databases for neuropsychological research. The automated delineation of stroke lesions from {CT} scans may also enable longitudinal studies to quantify changes in damaged tissue in an objective and reproducible manner.},

The most popular standard templates are derived from {MRI} scans of young adults. We introduce specialized templates that allow normalization algorithms to be applied to stroke-aged populations. First, we developed a {CT} template: while this is the dominant modality for many clinical situations, there are no modern {CT} templates and popular algorithms fail to successfully normalize {CT} scans. Importantly, our template was based on healthy individuals with ages similar to what is commonly seen in stroke (mean 65 years old). This template allows studies where only {CT} scans are available. Second, we derived a {MRI} template that approximately matches the shape of our {CT} template as well as processing steps that aid the normalization of scans from older individuals (including lesion masking and the ability to generate high quality cortical renderings despite brain injury). The benefit of this strategy is that the resulting templates can be used in studies where mixed modalities are present. We have integrated these templates and processing algorithms into a simple {SPM} toolbox (http://www.mricro.com/clinical-toolbox/spm8-scripts).},

Accordingly, most scientific journals require authors to report experimental procedures in sufficient detail for independent researchers to replicate their work. To what extent do research reports in the functional neuroimaging literature live up to this standard? The present study evaluated methods reporting and methodological choices across 241 recent {fMRI} articles. Many studies did not report critical methodological details with regard to experimental design, data acquisition, and analysis. Further, many studies were underpowered to detect any but the largest statistical effects. Finally, data collection and analysis methods were highly flexible across studies, with nearly as many unique analysis pipelines as there were studies in the sample. Because the rate of false positive results is thought to increase with the flexibility of experimental designs, the field of functional neuroimaging may be particularly vulnerable to false positives. In sum, the present study documented significant gaps in methods reporting among {fMRI} studies. Improved methodological descriptions in research reports would yield significant benefits for the field.},

The `lasso' minimizes the residual sum of squares subject to the sum of the absolute value of the coefficients being less than a constant. Because of the nature of this constraint it tends to produce some coefficients that are exactly 0 and hence gives interpretable models. Our simulation studies suggest that the lasso enjoys some of the favourable properties of both subset selection and ridge regression. It produces interpretable models like subset selection and exhibits the stability of ridge regression. There is also an interesting relationship with recent work in adaptive function estimation by Donoho and Johnstone. The lasso idea is quite general and can be applied in a variety of statistical models: extensions to generalized regression models and tree-based models are briefly described.},

We determined the accuracy of {ABC}/2 method as an on-site test in comparison with the gold standard central {HV}-assessment and semiautomatic {HV}-assessment.
MethodâWe analyzed data from an acute intracerebral hemorrhage multicenter clinical trial. {HV} was measured by site investigators to determine enrollment eligibility ({\textless}60 cm3) using the {ABC}/2 method (on-site {HV}), and independently by the core-imaging laboratory using computer-based analysis (Medical Image Processing, Analysis, and Visualization [{MIPAV}] {HV}). {HV} was also measured by {ABC}/2 method (central {HV}) at the core-imaging laboratory to assess the difference in measurements between on-site (multiple raters with variable experiences) and central (single experienced rater) {HVs}.
ResultsâFifty-six subjects were analyzed (mean age 62Â±15 years; 45\% women). On-site {HV} values showed a significantly lower correlation with the {MIPAV} {HV} (r=0.63) than central {HV} and {MIPAV} {HV} (r=0.93) values. The correlation between on-site {HV} and central {HV} values was modest (r=0.51). A total of 73\% of the central {HVs} were within 25\% of the corresponding {MIPAV} {HVs}, whereas only 46\% of the on-site {HVs} were within 25\% of the corresponding {MIPAV} {HVs} (P{\textless}0.001). One protocol violation occurred as a result of inaccuracy of on-site {HV} measurement.
ConclusionâOn-site {HV} measurements showed high variability, but the impact on the eligibility determination was small. Centralized remeasurements of {HVs} with feedback to the sites may increase the reliability of the on-site {HV} measurements.

{BACKGROUND} {AND} {PURPOSE}
Infarct volume is used as a surrogate outcome measure in clinical trials of therapies for acute ischemic stroke. {ABC}/2 is a fast volumetric method, but its accuracy remains to be determined. We aimed to study the accuracy and reproducibility of {ABC}/2 in determining acute infarct volume with diffusion-weighted imaging.
{METHODS}
We studied 86 consecutive patients with acute ischemic stroke. Three blinded observers determined volume with the {ABC}/2 method, and the results were compared with those of the manual planimetric method.
{RESULTS}
The {ABC}/2 technique overestimated infarct volume by a median false increase (variable {ABC}/2 volume minus planimetric volume) of 7.33 cm3 (1.29, 22.170, representing a 162.56\% increase over the value of the gold standard (variable {ABC}/2 volume over planimetric volume) (121.70, 248.52). In each method, the interrater reliability was excellent: the intraclass correlations were .992 and .985 for the {ABC}/2 technique and planimetric method, respectively.
{CONCLUSIONS}
{ABC}/2 is volumetric method with clinical value but it consistently overestimates the real infarct volume. J Neuroimaging 2012;22:155-159},

Test-retest reliability did not differ significantly among a neurologist, a neurology house officer, a neurology nurse, or an emergency department nurse. The stroke scale validity was assessed by comparing the scale scores obtained prospectively on 65 acute stroke patients to the patients' infarction size as measured by computed tomography scan at 1 week and to the patients' clinical outcome as determined at 3 months. These correlations (scale-lesion size r = 0.68, scale-outcome r = 0.79) suggested acceptable examination and scale validity. Of the 15 test items, the most interrater reliable item (pupillary response) had low validity. Less reliable items such as upper or lower extremity motor function were more valid.

	abstract = {Structural delineation and assignment are the fundamental steps in understanding the anatomy of the human brain. The white matter has been structurally defined in the past only at its core regions (deep white matter). However, the most peripheral white matter areas, which are interleaved between the cortex and the deep white matter, have lacked clear anatomical definitions and parcellations. We used axonal fiber alignment information from diffusion tensor imaging ({DTI}) to delineate the peripheral white matter, and investigated its relationship with the cortex and the deep white matter. Using {DTI} data from 81 healthy subjects, we identified nine common, blade-like anatomical regions, which were further parcellated into 21 subregions based on the cortical anatomy. Four short association fiber tracts connecting adjacent gyri (U-fibers) were also identified reproducibly among the healthy population. We anticipate that this atlas will be useful resource for atlas-based white matter anatomical studies.},
